# Udacity - Creating Customer Segments with Arvato
This is part of "Intro to Machine Learning" Nanodegree.

## Prequisite:
* Python 3.6

## Project Overview:

In this project, real-life data was provided to us by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns one of Arvato’s client that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. The unsupervised learning algorithm: KMeans was used to organize the general population into clusters, then used those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the Arvato’s client company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, data was assessed and cleaned in order to convert the data into a usable form. Dimensionality of the data was reduced using Principal Component Analysis(PCA) to find the vectors of maximal variability and missing values were replaced using Imputer.
