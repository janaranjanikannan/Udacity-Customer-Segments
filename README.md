# # Udacity - Creating Customer Segments with Arvato
This is part of "Intro to Machine Learning" Nanodegree.

This project is to implement an image classifier with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line applications: train.py, predict.py.

## Prequisite:
* Python 3.6

## Overview:

In this project, real-life data was provided to us by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. The unsupervised learning techniques was used to organize the general population into clusters, then used those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, data was assessed and cleaned in order to convert the data into a usable form. Dimensionality of the data was reduced using PCA and missing values replaced using Imputer.
